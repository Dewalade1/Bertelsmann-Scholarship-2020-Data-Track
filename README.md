# Bertelsmann Scholarship 2020 Data Track Learning Progress
------------------------------------------------------------

#### Hey there, This a record of my learning progress on the Bertelsman scholarship data track. It also contains my progress on fulfilling the 60 days of udacity challenge. I took the pledge on December 14, 2020 but I could not keep up with it so I decided to start over from the beginning starting on January 26th, 2021. I also decided to review the entire course in order to refresh my memory and get a little practice in with alteryx.

*Credits: Unless specified, all images were gotten from Bertelsman scholarship data challenge course: Introduction to Problem Solving with Advanced Analytics Nanodegree Program by Udacity*

## DAY 1 (26/01/2021)

* Restarted the pledge and reviewed lesson 1.
* The basis of this lesson is to use the **Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM)** as a **Problem Solving Framework** for our Analysis.
* CRISP-DM consists of the following steps: 
  1. Business Issue Understanding
  2. Data Understanding
  3. Data Preparation
  4. Analysis/Modeling
  5. Validation
  6. Presentation/ Visualization.
* Steps of the CRISP-DM framework may be performed multiple times or restart the entire problem solving framework and revise some of the assumptions and decisions made along the way.

**Note:** Don't throw all your data at your model and hope for the best

## Day 2 (27/01/2021)

* Studied lesson 2.1 - 2.8
* The methodology map is meant to be used as we work our way through the analytical problem solving framework.
* It helps us decide which methodology to use to solve a business problem.
* There are 2 types of businesss problems: Predictive and Analytical.

## Day 3 (28/01/2021)

* Completed Lesson 2
* The methodology map can be used to select the proper model for solving a business problem.
* There are three types of numerical data: Count, Categorical and Time-series
* There are two categories of classification data: Binary and Non-binary classification

*Binary classification*

## Day 4 (29/01/2021)

* Started Lesson 3
* Learnt to perform linear Regression and multiple linear regression analysis using excel
* Learnt about correlation between predictor and target variables.

*Graph of lack of correlation between predictor and target variables*

## Day 5 (30/01/2021)

* Learnt about parallel processing in python on Dataquest.
* Parallel processing can be used to run multiple tasks at the same time.
* There are several workflows for running parallel processes such as starting and joining them simultatiously using for loops or starting each process individually at your prefered times.
* Processes take in functions and arguments for those functions as separate arguments
* Each process is has its own unshared memory
* A shared memory location (shared value) can be created for all processes using the `multiprocessing.Value()` command
* Shared values can be locked from processes preventing them from being updated by certain processes by using a **lock**

## DAY 6 (31/01/2021)

* Studied a course on Time Management

## DAY 7 (01/02/2021)

 * Took a course on executive datastory telling by Data Story Acadamy
 * I learnt about the general types of executives and their prefered data story and dashboard delivery methods
 * The 5 types are the Data Geek (loves data), Emailer (prefers emails), Traveler (travels a lot so their always on their phones), Presenter (loves presentations) and Old School (prefers PDFs & printouts)
 * I learnt that understanding your executives priorities help deliver better data stories.
 * To understand them, ask questions about what they whanna answer, what actions they intend to take with the results, and what key results or metric they are after
 
## DAY 8 (02/02/2021)

* Studied Chapter 2: Flow control of automate the boring stuff with python.
* Learnt about using flowcharts and the elements of flow control.

## DAY 9 (03/02/2021)

* I spent the day downloading and installing alteryx on my windows PC

## DAY 10 (04/02/2021)

* I learnt how to choose colors to [make your visualizations look more professional](https://blog.datawrapper.de/beautifulcolors/)
* I also learned to [never use pure black in visualizations](https://ianstormtaylor.com/design-tip-never-use-black/)
* I also learnt good ways to choose color lighting is to [check colors in greyscale](https://blog.datawrapper.de/colorblind-check/) using [Color Oracle](http://www.colororacle.org/) and [Vizcheck](http://vischeck.com/)
* I found some useful tools to help me select better colors for my visualizations. These tools are: [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel), [Color Calculator](https://www.sessions.edu/color-calculator/), and [Learnui color palette picker](https://learnui.design/tools/data-color-picker.html#palette) 
* I found tools to pick out image colors using [Color Picker](https://image-color.com/) and [Adobe Capture](https://www.adobe.com/products/capture.html)

## DAY 11 (05/02/2021)

* Learnt about r-squared and adjusted r-squared for linear and multiple linear regression analysis
* Signed up for Alteryx

## DAY 12 (06/02/2021)

* Completed lesson 3
* Learnt how to read an alteryx data analysis report
