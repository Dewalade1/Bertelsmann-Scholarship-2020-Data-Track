# Bertelsmann Scholarship 2020 Data Track Learning Progress
------------------------------------------------------------

#### Hey there, This a record of my learning progress on the Bertelsman scholarship data track. It also contains my progress on fulfilling the 60 days of udacity challenge. I took the pledge on December 14, 2020 but I could not keep up with it so I decided to start over from the beginning starting on January 26th, 2021. I also decided to review the entire course in order to refresh my memory and get a little practice in with alteryx.

## DAY 1 (26/01/2021)

* Restarted the pledge and reviewed lesson 1.


## Day 2 (27/01/2021)

* Studied lesson 2.1 - 2.8
* There are 2 types of businesss problems: Predictive and Analytical.

## Day 3 (28/01/2021)

* Completed Lesson 2
* The methodology map can be used in different senarios.

## Day 4 (29/01/2021)

* Started Lesson 3

## Day 5 (30/01/2021)

* Learnt about parallel processing in python on Dataquest.
* Parallel processing can be used to run multiple tasks at the same time.
* There are several workflows for running parallel processes such as starting and joining them simultatiously using for loops or starting each process individually at your prefered times.
* Processes take in functions and arguments for those functions as separate arguments
* Each process is has its own unshared memory
* A shared memory location (shared value) can be created for all processes using the `multiprocessing.Value()` command
* Shared values can be locked from processes preventing them from being updated by certain processes by using a **lock**

## DAY 6 (31/01/2021)

* Studied a course on Time Management

## DAY 7 (01/02/2021)

 * Took a course on executive datastory telling by Data Story Acadamy
 * I learnt about the general types of executives and their prefered data story and dashboard delivery methods
 * The 5 types are the Data Geek (loves data), Emailer (prefers emails), Traveler (travels a lot so their always on their phones), Presenter (loves presentations) and Old School (prefers PDFs & printouts)
 * I learnt that understanding your executives priorities help deliver better data stories.
 * To understand them, ask questions about what they whanna answer, what actions they intend to take with the results, and what key results or metric they are after
 
## DAY 8 (02/02/2021)

* Studied Chapter 2: Flow control of automate the boring stuff with python.
* Learnt about using flowcharts and the elements of flow control.
