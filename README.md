# Bertelsmann Scholarship 2020 Data Track Learning Progress
------------------------------------------------------------

#### Hey there, This a record of my learning progress on the Bertelsman scholarship data track. It also contains my progress on fulfilling the 60 days of udacity challenge. I took the pledge on December 14, 2020 but I could not keep up with it so I decided to start over from the beginning starting on January 26th, 2021. I also decided to review the entire course in order to refresh my memory and get a little practice in.

## Day 3 (28/01/2021)
